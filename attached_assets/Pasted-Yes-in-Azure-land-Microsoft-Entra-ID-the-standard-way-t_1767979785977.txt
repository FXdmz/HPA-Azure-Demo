Yes, in "Azure land" (Microsoft Entra ID), the standard way to handle this for your application is using **App Roles**.

When a user logs in via the setup you have in `src/config/auth.ts`, Azure can inject a `roles` array directly into their **ID Token**. You don't need to make an extra API call; the roles just arrive with the user's profile.

Here is how to set it up and access it.

### **Step 1: Define Roles in Azure Portal**

You need to tell Azure what roles exist for your app (e.g., `Admin`, `User`).

1. Go to the **[Azure Portal](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://portal.azure.com)** > **Microsoft Entra ID**.
2. Go to **App registrations** > Select your app (`Aesher-HPA-1-7-25` based on your config).
3. In the left menu, click **App roles**.
4. Click **+ Create app role**.
* **Display name:** `Admin`
* **Allowed member types:** Users/Groups
* **Value:** `App.Admin` (This is the string you will check in code)
* **Description:** Admins can manage settings.
* *Click Apply.*



### **Step 2: Assign Users to Roles**

Now you grant those roles to specific people.

1. Go back to **Microsoft Entra ID** main menu.
2. Go to **Enterprise applications** (NOT App registrations).
3. Find and click on your app (`Aesher-HPA-1-7-25`).
4. Go to **Users and groups**.
5. Click **+ Add user/group**.
* Select the User (e.g., yourself).
* Select the Role (e.g., `Admin`).
* *Click Assign.*



### **Step 3: Get the Roles in Your Code (React)**

Your frontend is already using `useMsal`. You can access the roles immediately after login via `idTokenClaims`.

You can modify `src/components/ChatInterface.tsx` (or wherever you check permissions) like this:

```typescript
import { useMsal } from "@azure/msal-react";

export function ChatInterface() {
  const { accounts } = useMsal();
  const account = accounts[0];

  // 1. Get Roles from the Token
  // The 'roles' claim is an array of strings (e.g., ["App.Admin"])
  const userRoles = (account?.idTokenClaims as any)?.roles || [];

  // 2. Check Permission
  const isAdmin = userRoles.includes("App.Admin");

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Welcome, {account?.name}</h1>
      
      {/* 3. Show content based on Role */}
      {isAdmin && (
        <button className="bg-red-500 text-white p-2">
           Admin Settings (Only visible to App.Admin)
        </button>
      )}
      
      <div>Your Roles: {userRoles.join(", ")}</div>
    </div>
  );
}

```

### **Summary**

* **No Extra API Calls:** The roles come inside the token you are already getting in `src/config/auth.ts`.
* **Security:** This is secure because the `roles` claim is signed by Microsoft. A user cannot fake it on the frontend.
